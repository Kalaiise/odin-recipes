        <h2>Yes, thats right, butter garlic clams.</h2>
        <p>Found in nearly every seafood boil but something about feeling like im eating a piece of a mountain bike tire doesnt</p>
        <p>sit right with me which makes it a strong contender for this list.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons Finlandia Unsalted Butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 dozen little neck clams, rinsed and scrubbed</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>Wedges from 1 lemon for garnish, if desired</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet (that has a lid), melt 2-½ tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>Add wine and lemon juice. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add clams and remaining butter. Cover and steam until clams have opened (about 7-8 minutes). Occasionally shake skillet while steaming.</li>
            <li>Discard any clams that do not open. Sprinkle evenly with parsley and garnish with lemon wedges, if desired. Serve with a french baguette or over a bed of cooked pasta.</li>
        </ol>
